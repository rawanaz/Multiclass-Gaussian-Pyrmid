# Multiclass-Gaussian-Pyrmid
Gaussian Pyramid is a robust Nonlinear Support Vector Machine classification model for use in high-dimensional data. 

We pass the Gaussian pyramid on the large-scale dataset to minimize the degree of nonlinearity and reduce the size of the dataset to 1/4 of the size of the original large dataset.
